```bash
export HF_READ_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

## üöÄ Running the Application

### Option 1: Complete Application (API + UI)
Run both the FastAPI backend and Gradio UI:
```bash
python main.py
```
This will start:
- FastAPI server on http://localhost:8000
- Gradio UI on http://localhost:7860

### Option 2: API Only
Run just the FastAPI backend:
```bash
uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

## üìö API Documentation

Once the server is running, access the API documentation at:
- Swagger UI: http://localhost:8000/docs
- ReDoc: http://localhost:8000/redoc

## üîë Key Endpoints

- `POST /agent/query`: Send queries to the AI agent
- `POST /calendar/create-event`: Create Google Calendar events
- `POST /google/connect`: Connect Google account
- `GET /`: Redirects to Gradio UI

## üîê First-Time Google Calendar Setup

When you first run the application and try to use Google Calendar features:

1. The application will prompt you to authenticate
2. A browser window will open asking you to sign in to your Google account
3. You may see a warning that the app is "unverified" - click "Advanced" and "Go to [Your App Name] (unsafe)"
4. Grant the requested Calendar permissions
5. The application will save the authentication token locally as `token.pickle` for future use

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- The application requires active internet connection for AI model access
- Some features may require Hugging Face API token for full functionality
- Google Calendar integration will work in "unverified app" mode for development
- For production use, you should verify your app with Google
